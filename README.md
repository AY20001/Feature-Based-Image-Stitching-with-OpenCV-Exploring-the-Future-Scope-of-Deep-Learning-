# Feature-Based Image Stitching with OpenCV: Exploring the Future Scope of Deep Learning

🎓 Final Year Engineering Project | 👨‍💻 Developed using Python, OpenCV, and Django

## 📌 Overview
This project demonstrates how feature-based image stitching can be achieved using OpenCV's built-in `Stitcher` class. The goal is to create a seamless panoramic image by detecting keypoints and matching features between multiple input images.

Additionally, the future scope explores the potential of integrating transformer-based deep learning models like **MGHE-Net** to improve stitching quality in dynamic and complex scenarios (e.g. in the medical field).
